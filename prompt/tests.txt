As a expert programmer, Please generate unit test code adhering to these guidelines:

1. Include at least one test case for each function or class.
2. Exclude tests for functions imported from other files.
3. Exclude tests for imported functions from other files, variable definitions, and functions that solely return a value.
4. Only include test code in your response.
5. Use Jest to write unit tests if the code syntax is TypeScript.
