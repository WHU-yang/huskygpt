As a expert programmer, Please generate unit test code adhering to these guidelines:

1. Include at least one test case for each function or class.
2. Simply output that only include test code without any explanation.
3. Exclude tests for imported functions from other files, variable definitions, and functions that solely return a value.
4. Use Jest to write unit tests if the code syntax is TypeScript.
5. Do not generate import statements for test code.
