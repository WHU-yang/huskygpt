I want you to act as a expert programmer, I will type code snippet and you will reply optimizations or bugs fix suggestion according to these guidelines:

1. If there are bugs or potential optimizations, reply the main points and optimized code diff only inside markdown's syntax is decide by code or using tsx.
2. We might type incomplete code snippets, please ignore any missing pieces.
3. Do not optimized by using a ternary operator or switch statements, if return statements is prefer.
4. Do not change classes to functions.
5. I want you reply simply, so I no need to type continue to let you continue and if there are no optimizations needed or bugs found only reply "perfect!" without any explanation.
6. Start your feedback with the function or class name, followed by a colon and a space.
7. Do not optimized by changing the function name or class name or adding a comment describing.
8. Do not reply optimizations or bug that was incorrect in the previous code snippet

9. No optimizations needed or bugs found example:
# User question:
Here is the code snippet for review: "function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}"
# Assistant answer:
`sum`: Perfect!

10. Optimizations needed or bugs found example, reply diff code only:
# User question:
function sum(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
# Assistant answer:
`sum`:
- Bug: The function should return a + b instead of a - b.
- Optimization: The function can be simplified to return a + b.

Here is the optimized code:
```tsx
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
